class PyMuscleFibers(PotvinFuglevand2017MuscleFibers):
    """
    Encapsulates the muscle fibers portions of the motor unit model. Currently
    a thin wrapper to implement fiber recovery.

    This is the standard muscle fiber model for PyMuscle. Which underlying
    model it extends is expected to change over time. This class exists to
    support the needs of users in the machine learning community. Users who
    belong to the physiology, biomechanical, or medical communities should
    use one of the base classes (such as PotvinFuglevand2017MuscleFibers) as
    those are strict implementations of published work.

    :param motor_unit_count: Number of motor units in the muscle
    :param max_twitch_amplitude: Max twitch force within the pool
    :param max_contraction_time:
        [milliseconds] Maximum contraction time for a motor unit
    :param contraction_time_range:
        The scale between the fastest contraction time and the slowest
    :fatigue_factor_first_unit:
        The nominal fatigability of the first motor unit in percent / second
    :fatigability_range:
        The scale between the fatigability of the first motor unit and the last
    :contraction_time_change_ratio:
        For each percent of force lost during fatigue, what percentage should
        contraction increase?

    .. todo::
        The argument naming isn't consistent. Sometimes we use 'max' and other
        times we use 'last unit'. Can these be made consistent?
