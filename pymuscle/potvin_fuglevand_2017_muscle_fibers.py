    Encapsulates the muscle fibers portions of the motor unit model.

    The name of each parameter as it appears in Potvin, 2017 is in parentheses.
    If a parameter does not appear in the paper but does appear in the Matlab
    code, the variable name from the Matlab code is in parentheses.

    :param motor_unit_count: Number of motor units in the muscle (n)
    :param max_twitch_amplitude: Max twitch force within the pool (RP)
    :param max_contraction_time:
        [milliseconds] Maximum contraction time for a motor unit (tL)
    :param contraction_time_range:
        The scale between the fastest contraction time and the slowest (rt)
    :fatigue_factor_first_unit:
        The nominal fatigability of the first motor unit in percent / second
    :fatigability_range:
        The scale between the fatigability of the first motor unit and the last

        For each percent of force lost during fatigue, what percentage should
        contraction increase? Based on Shields et al (1997)

        The argument naming isn't consistent. Sometimes we use 'max' and other
        times we use 'last unit'. Can these be made consistent?
